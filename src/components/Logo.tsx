/**
 * The NØRR3 wordmark.
 *
 * There used to be a triangle mark shown beside it (the numeral 3, in the
 * brand's other asset, morphs into one) and the wordmark used to be that
 * animated SVG directly. Both were removed: the mark is not part of the logo
 * as used on the site, and a shape morphing on a 6.2s loop in the header of
 * every page was more motion than the brand wanted. This is the wordmark
 * alone, static — `public/logo-wordmark.svg` is `logo-animated.svg` with its
 * SMIL `<animate>` elements stripped (171KB down to 6KB).
 *
 * Kept as an `<img>` rather than inlined: it is one asset shared and cached
 * across every page, and recolours for dark mode via a `brightness-0 invert`
 * filter rather than `currentColor`, so callers pass that as `className`.
